Vanta Tag Privacy Policy

Vanta Tag ("we," "our," or "us") values the privacy and security of our users' personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data when you access and use our Virtual Reality game Vanta Tag.

Information We Collect:

We collect some simple things like your age, your Meta account’s name, and your email. This is used for knowing what ages are playing with each other, and if there is someone under the age of 13 interacting with people who are, for example, 18+, we use the email and name to ban them and protect the valued child.

How We Use Your Information:

Personal Information: We will use your Personal Information solely for the purposes for which it was collected. This may include responding to your inquiries or providing you with updates about the Game if you have opted to receive such communications.

Non-Personal Information: Non-Personal Information is primarily used to analyze trends, improve the Game's performance, and enhance your gaming experience. This information is collected on an aggregated basis and does not identify individual users.

Sharing of Your Information: We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personal Information to third parties. We may share non-personal information with our affiliates, service providers, and business partners for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Data Security: We take appropriate measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security due to the inherent risks of data transmission over the internet or electronic storage.

User Data Deletion: If you would like to delete your collected personal data from our systems, you can do so by contacting us at sharpzfta12@gmail.com.We will process your request and delete your data within a reasonable timeframe. Please note that certain data may be retained for legal or legitimate business purposes.

Third-Party Services: The Game may include links to third-party websites or services, each with their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party sites and encourage you to review their policies before providing any information.
